My name is Timothy Jackson and this is my first project while learning to code.

Goals:

*create a webpage that looks and feels identical to the www.google.com homepage.

*learn how to use the developer tools

*link html+css documents together to display the webpage

*get familiar with github and adding/removing/updating my repository.

Completion Notes:

01/06/2021: I got the webpage setup to look like google as much as I can currently. Ended up using position:absolute and a combination of left,bottom,right,top & margin spacing to fit to corners. Ended up using devtools some to get correct sizing for Google Search, I'm Feeling Lucky buttons and also the search bar. Pulled font , colors from devtools. Going to spend a little bit more time refining for another update. Need to add :hover + shadows and a bottom border box for the footer. May revisit after doing new projects and learning more to refine the google homepage at a later time.

01/07/2021:
Website Layout Improvements:

-resized mutliple elements correctly after finding the size in dev tools. "about, store, gmail, images, sign in, advertising, business, how search works, privacy, terms, settings"

-added button layout and correct styles to "Google Search, I'm Feeling Lucky" including a blue or black border color when clicked on.

-resized and added a shadow-box to input search bar.

-added :hover elements to most text on screen and input search bar.

-removed bottom center text that said "carbon nuetral since 2007" it was causing me problems with the box being to big and wasn't allowing :hover to work on left side text. Didn't think it really needed to be on the page so removed.
 
Github repository updates: "adding as this was apart of some of my goals"

-used git remote add url and git remote remove to update terminal correctly. kept asking me for a user&pass previiously. now no longer required.

-went into repository settings and updated my Source fot GitHub Pages. Published my google_homepage site.

html.index update:

-added !DOCTYPE html declaration. I had it included on first draft but site seemed to load it without so i deleted it. Turns out it just tells the system what type of document it is. TIL

conclusion - moving on for now. with future projects I will learn more and may return back to this to finetune more.
