Introduction: My name is Timothy Jackson and this is my first project while learning to code
Goals:
*create a webpage that looks and feels identical to the www.google.com homepage.
*learn how to use the developer tools
*link html+css documents together to display the webpage
*get familiar with github and adding/removing/updating my repository.

Completion Notes:

01/06/2021: I got the webpage setup to look like google as much as I can currently. Ended up using position:absolute
and a combination of left,bottom,right,top & margin spacing to fit to corners. Ended up using devtools some
to get correct sizing for Google Search, I'm Feeling Lucky buttons and also the search bar. Pulled font , colors from devtools.
Going to spend a little bit more time refining for another update. Need to add :hover + shadows and a bottom border box
for the footer. May revisit after doing new projects and learning more to refine the google homepage at a later time.
